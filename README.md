## How the Naive Bayes Model Works for Predicting Heart Disease

In this model, we start by calculating the probability that an individual has or does not have heart disease. These are considered as initial guesses (referred to as **prior probabilities**). Once we have these prior probabilities, we proceed to calculate the probability of an individual with specific features, such as age, blood pressure, and other characteristics, having heart disease.

### Here's how the process works:

1. **Prior Probability**: First, we consider the probability that an individual either has or does not have heart disease.

2. **Calculating Probability for Each Feature**: For each feature (such as age or cholesterol level), we calculate the likelihood of that feature appearing in individuals with and without heart disease. For example, we calculate the probability that a person with a certain blood pressure level has heart disease.

3. **Combining Probabilities**: Then, we combine these probabilities (by multiplying the probabilities of each feature). This means for each feature, such as age, blood pressure, or cholesterol, we calculate the probability of having heart disease, and then combine them to reach an overall result.

4. **Final Prediction**: Finally, we see which condition (having or not having heart disease) has the highest probability, and we select that as the final prediction.

For example, if an individual has high cholesterol and high blood pressure, we calculate the probability that they have heart disease based on these features and make a final prediction by also considering other features like age and gender.

It's important to note that the Naive Bayes model assumes that features are independent of each other, meaning, for example, that cholesterol level does not affect age. Although this assumption is not always true in reality, the model still performs well and is computationally efficient.
